# Keeper Management Component Enhancement Plan

## 🎯 **Overview**
This document outlines a comprehensive enhancement plan for the KeeperManagement component to improve both desktop and mobile search functionality, visual design, and overall user experience.

## 📊 **Current State Analysis**
- **Mobile**: Already uses `SearchableSelect` with search functionality

   - Color-coded player positions and stats
   - Smooth animations for adding/removing keepers
   - Visual progress indicators for keeper limits

3. **Player Stats Preview**
   - Quick stats preview in search results
   - Fantasy score calculations
   - Player comparison features
   - Recent performance indicators

4. **Improved Keeper Limits UI**
