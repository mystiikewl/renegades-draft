# DraftBoard Enhancement Plan

## Overview
This document outlines a comprehensive enhancement plan for the DraftBoard component in the Renegades Draft application. The goal is to significantly improve the user experience by adding advanced features, better visual design, and enhanced functionality inspired by professional fantasy sports platforms like Sleeper.

## Current State Analysis
The current DraftBoard component includes:
- Basic grid layout with team colors
- Simple accordion for player details
- Limited stats display (points, rebounds, assists)
- Basic responsive design
- Current pick highlighting
