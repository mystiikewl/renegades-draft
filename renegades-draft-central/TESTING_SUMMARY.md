# Testing and Code Quality Improvements

## ESLint Fixes

We've successfully fixed the two critical ESLint errors in the codebase:

1. **AuthForm.tsx**: Replaced `any` type with proper `ProfileWithTeam | null` type
2. **MakePickDialog.tsx**: Replaced `any` type with proper error handling using `instanceof Error`

These fixes eliminate the critical type safety issues that were blocking production readiness.

## Testing Framework Setup

We've successfully set up a comprehensive testing framework with:

1. **Vitest** as the test runner
2. **React Testing Library** for component testing
3. **jsdom** for DOM simulation
4. **Test coverage** reporting

## Test Scripts Added

We've added the following npm scripts to package.json:
- `test`: Run tests in watch mode
- `test:ui`: Run tests with UI interface
- `test:run`: Run tests once
- `test:coverage`: Run tests with coverage report

## Sample Tests Created

We've created tests for critical user flows:

1. **Button component tests** (2 tests):
   - Renders correctly with default variant
   - Renders correctly with secondary variant

2. **AuthForm component tests** (2 tests):
   - Renders sign in and sign up tabs
   - Allows user to switch between sign in and sign up

3. **DraftHero component tests** (1 test):
   - Renders draft information correctly

All 5 tests are currently passing, providing a solid foundation for testing the application.

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Expand test coverage** to include more components and user flows
2. **Add integration tests** for Supabase interactions
3. **Add end-to-end tests** using Cypress or Playwright
4. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** to run tests automatically
5. **Add test coverage requirements** to prevent regressions
