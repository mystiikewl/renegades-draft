# Next Steps for Deploying Renegades Draft

Congratulations! Your code is now on GitHub and ready for deployment. Here are the immediate next steps to get your Renegades Draft application live:

## 1. Set Up Your Supabase Project

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com/ and create a new project
2. Choose a name for your project (e.g., "renegades-draft")
3. Select a region closest to your users
4. Set a strong database password
5. Wait for the project to be created (this may take a few minutes)

## 2. Get Your Supabase Credentials

Once your project is ready:
1. Click on your project to access the dashboard
2. In the left sidebar, click on "Project Settings" (gear icon)
3. Go to the "API" tab
4. Copy your "Project URL" and "Project API keys" (use the public anon key)
5. Save these credentials temporarily - you'll need them for Netlify

## 3. Set Up the Database

Run the Supabase setup script:
```
# On Windows, run:
setup-supabase.bat

# On Mac/Linux, run:
chmod +x setup-supabase.sh
./setup-supabase.sh
```

When prompted, enter your Supabase project reference (found in your project settings).

Alternatively, you can manually run the migrations:
1. In your Supabase dashboard, go to the SQL editor
2. Run each SQL file from the `supabase/migrations` directory in order

## 4. Deploy to Netlify

1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Click "New site from Git"
3. Connect to GitHub and select your `mystiikewl/renegades-draft` repository
4. Configure the deployment settings:
   - Branch to deploy: master
   - Base directory: renegades-draft-central
   - Build command: npm run build
   - Publish directory: dist
5. Before deploying, add your environment variables:
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` = Your Supabase Project URL
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` = Your Supabase anon key

## 5. Update Supabase Redirect URLs

After your Netlify site is deployed:
1. Note your Netlify domain (e.g., `your-site-name.netlify.app`)
2. Go back to your Supabase project
3. Go to Authentication > Settings
4. Add your Netlify domain to "Additional Redirect URLs":
   - `https://your-netlify-domain.netlify.app/**`

## 6. Test Your Deployment

1. Visit your Netlify site URL
2. Try signing up for a new account
3. Test the draft functionality
4. Verify real-time updates work with multiple browser windows

## Need Help?

If you run into any issues:

1. Check the build logs in Netlify for deployment errors
2. Check the browser console for frontend errors
3. Check the Supabase logs for database errors
4. Refer to the DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for detailed instructions
5. Use the DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md to ensure you haven't missed any steps

## After Successful Deployment

1. Update the documentation in the `documentation` folder with any deployment-specific information
2. Set up monitoring and analytics as described in the deployment guide
3. Test with a few friends before your actual draft
4. Consider setting up a custom domain for a more professional appearance

Your application is well-structured and ready for production. The deployment process should go smoothly if you follow these steps!
