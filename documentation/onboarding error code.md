# Onboarding Flow Troubleshooting and Resolution

This document outlines the issues encountered during the user onboarding process, specifically related to team claiming and subsequent navigation, and their resolutions.

## Original Problem: Failed to Claim Team (Integer vs. UUID Ambiguity)

**Error Message:** `Failed to claim team: Could not choose the best candidate function between: public.claim_team(target_team_id => integer), public.claim_team(target_team_id => uuid)`

**Description:** New users attempting to claim a team were stuck in a loop on the "Select Your Team" page. The database was unable to resolve which `claim_team` function to use due to an overloaded function signature, where one version expected an `integer` and another a `uuid` for `target_team_id`. Additionally, the `profiles` table's `team_id` was not being updated, and the `teams` table's `owner_email` remained `NULL`.

## Resolution Steps:

1.  **Database Function Overload Resolution (`20250817060000_resolve_claim_team_overload.sql`)**:
    *   Explicitly dropped all existing `claim_team` functions (both `integer` and `uuid` versions).
    *   Re-created the `claim_team` function to strictly accept a `uuid` for `target_team_id`, ensuring no ambiguity.

2.  **`auth.uid()` Context Fix (`20250817100000_set_claim_team_search_path.sql`)**:
    *   Discovered that `auth.uid()` was returning `NULL` within the `claim_team` function, preventing the `UPDATE` statement from matching any user profiles.
    *   Modified the `claim_team` function to explicitly set the `search_path` to include the `auth` schema (`SET search_path TO public, auth;`), ensuring `auth.uid()` correctly resolves the authenticated user's ID.

3.  **`profiles` Table Update Logic (`20250817080000_fix_claim_team_profile_update.sql`)**:
    *   Identified that the `claim_team` function was incorrectly using `id` instead of `user_id` in its `WHERE` clause when updating the `public.profiles` table.
    *   Corrected the `UPDATE` statement to `where user_id = current_user_id;` to ensure the correct column was used for matching the user's profile.

4.  **Enhanced Error Handling in `claim_team` (`20250817090000_enhance_claim_team_error_handling.sql`)**:
    *   Added `GET DIAGNOSTICS updated_rows = ROW_COUNT;` to the `claim_team` function to verify if the `UPDATE` statement actually modified any rows.
    *   Implemented a check to return an error message if `updated_rows` is `0`, preventing misleading "Success" notifications when no actual update occurred.

5.  **`teams` Table Ownership Update (`20250817110000_update_claim_team_to_set_owner_email.sql`)**:
    *   Modified the `claim_team` function to also update the `public.teams` table, setting the `owner_email` for the claimed team using `auth.email()`. This ensures the team ownership is correctly reflected in the `teams` table.

6.  **Frontend Redirection Fix (`renegades-draft-central/src/pages/Onboarding.tsx`)**:
    *   Corrected the navigation path in `handleKeepersSelected` from `/team` to `/teams` to match the plural route defined in `renegades-draft-central/src/App.tsx`, resolving the 404 error after confirming keepers.

## Current Status:

All identified issues related to the onboarding flow, team claiming, database updates, keeper management, and page redirection have been successfully resolved. The system is now working as intended.
