# Security Implementation Guide

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in the Renegades Draft application to prepare it for production deployment.

## Environment Variable Management

### Implementation

1. **Moved sensitive configuration to environment variables**:
   - Supabase URL is now loaded from `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - Supabase anonymous key is now loaded from `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

2. **Created environment files**:
   - `.env` - Contains actual configuration values (not committed to repository)
   - `.env.example` - Template showing required environment variables (committed to repository)

3. **Updated client initialization**:
   - Modified `src/integrations/supabase/client.ts` to use `import.meta.env` for environment variables
   - Added validation to ensure required environment variables are present

4. **Enhanced .gitignore**:
   - Added `.env` and `.env*.local` to prevent accidental commits of sensitive data

### Benefits

- **Security**: Sensitive credentials are no longer hardcoded in source files
- **Flexibility**: Different environments (development, staging, production) can use different configuration values
- **Compliance**: Better alignment with security best practices and compliance requirements

### Usage

1. **Development Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the example file and fill in your values
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your actual values
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   # Required variables
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

## Authentication Security

### Current Implementation

The application uses Supabase Auth for user authentication with the following features:

1. **Secure Session Management**:
   - Sessions are persisted in localStorage
   - Automatic token refresh is enabled
   - Secure storage mechanisms are used

2. **Row Level Security (RLS)**:
   - Database policies control access to sensitive data
   - Users can only access data they're authorized to view
   - Team ownership is enforced at the database level

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**:
   - Enable MFA for admin users
   - Implement time-based one-time passwords (TOTP)

2. **Password Policies**:
   - Enforce minimum password complexity requirements
   - Implement password expiration policies
   - Add breached password detection

3. **Session Management**:
   - Implement session timeout after inactivity
   - Add device tracking for user sessions
   - Provide session revocation capabilities

## Data Protection

### Current Implementation

1. **Data Encryption**:
   - Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS
   - Supabase handles encryption at rest for database storage

2. **Data Validation**:
   - Client-side validation for user inputs
   - Server-side validation for all database operations

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Sensitive Data Encryption**:
   - Implement field-level encryption for highly sensitive data
   - Use envelope encryption for key management

2. **Data Masking**:
   - Implement data masking for non-production environments
   - Use different data sets for development, testing, and production

## API Security

### Current Implementation

1. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Supabase implements rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Authentication endpoints have additional protection

2. **Input Validation**:
   - All API inputs are validated before processing
   - SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **API Gateway**:
   - Implement an API gateway for additional security layers
   - Add request/response logging for security monitoring

2. **CORS Configuration**:
   - Restrict CORS origins to known domains only
   - Implement strict CORS policies for sensitive endpoints

## Security Headers

### Recommended Implementation

1. **Content Security Policy (CSP)**:
   - Implement strict CSP headers to prevent XSS attacks
   - Use nonce-based script execution for dynamic content

2. **HTTP Security Headers**:
   - Add X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking
   - Implement X-Content-Type-Options to prevent MIME-sniffing
   - Add Referrer-Policy to control referrer information

## Monitoring and Logging

### Current Implementation

1. **Error Handling**:
   - Structured error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Error logging for debugging purposes

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Security Event Logging**:
   - Log authentication events (success/failure)
   - Log authorization violations
   - Log suspicious activities

2. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Implement real-time security monitoring
   - Set up alerts for security events
   - Integrate with security information and event management (SIEM) systems

## Security Testing

### Current Implementation

1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Tests cover authentication flows
   - Tests validate authorization logic

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Security Scanning**:
   - Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
   - Use tools like OWASP ZAP for vulnerability scanning

2. **Penetration Testing**:
   - Conduct regular penetration testing
   - Engage third-party security experts for assessments

## Compliance Considerations

### GDPR
- Implement data export functionality for user data
- Add data deletion capabilities
- Ensure user consent for data processing

### CCPA
- Implement "right to know" and "right to delete" features
- Provide opt-out mechanisms for data sales (if applicable)

## Incident Response

### Recommended Implementation

1. **Security Incident Response Plan**:
   - Define procedures for handling security incidents
   - Establish communication protocols for security events
   - Create escalation procedures for critical vulnerabilities

2. **Vulnerability Management**:
   - Implement regular vulnerability scanning
   - Establish patch management procedures
   - Monitor security advisories for dependencies

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Security Headers** - Add CSP and other security headers
2. **Enhance Authentication** - Add MFA and password policies
3. **Set up Security Monitoring** - Implement logging and alerting for security events
4. **Conduct Security Audit** - Engage third-party experts for comprehensive security assessment
5. **Implement Security Testing** - Add automated security scanning to CI/CD pipeline
