# Renegades Draft - Code Quality and Issue Management

## Overview

This document provides an overview of the current state of code quality and known issues in the Renegades Draft project, along with recommendations for improvement.

## Recent Improvements

### Supabase Types Refactoring
We've successfully refactored the monolithic `types.ts` file into a modular structure:
- Created separate files for each database table type
- Created separate files for each RPC function type
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing imports
- Improved code organization and maintainability

### Linting Issues Resolution
We've successfully resolved all linting errors in the codebase:
- ✅ Eliminated all 30 linting errors
- ✅ Fixed extensive use of `any` types throughout the codebase
- ✅ Addressed missing useEffect dependencies
- ✅ Resolved React Hook usage violations
- ✅ Implemented proper TypeScript typing throughout the application

## Current Issues

### 1. Linting Issues (Resolved)
We identified 30 linting errors and 12 warnings across the codebase. All errors have now been resolved:
- ✅ Fixed extensive use of `any` types that bypass TypeScript safety
- ✅ Addressed missing dependencies in `useEffect` hooks
- ✅ Resolved incorrect React Hook usage patterns
- ⏳ 11 remaining warnings (primarily React Fast Refresh issues)

**Action**: See [linting_issues.md](./linting_issues.md) for detailed analysis and [issues_tracking.md](./issues_tracking.md) for tracking progress.

### 2. Draft Pick Reset Error (High Priority)
Admin users cannot reset draft picks due to a database constraint violation.

**Action**: See [issues.md](./issues.md) for detailed error log and analysis.

### 3. Team Selection Issues (Medium Priority)
Users experience difficulties with team selection functionality.

**Action**: See [team_selection_issue.md](./team_selection_issue.md) for details.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Address the draft pick reset error to restore full admin functionality
2. Address remaining linting warnings for optimal code quality

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement proper error handling throughout the application
2. Add comprehensive test coverage for critical functionality
3. Address accessibility concerns

### Long-term Improvements
1. Refactor components to follow best practices
2. Implement performance optimizations
3. Add comprehensive documentation for all modules

## Quality Assurance

### Build Status
- ✅ TypeScript compilation: Successful
- ✅ Project build: Successful
- ✅ Linting: 0 errors, 11 warnings

### Testing
- No automated tests currently implemented
- Manual testing during development only

## Next Steps

1. **Assign ownership** of issues to team members
2. **Create GitHub issues** for better tracking
3. **Implement CI/CD** with linting and testing checks
4. **Schedule regular code reviews** to maintain quality
